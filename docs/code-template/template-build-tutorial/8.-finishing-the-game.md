# 8. Finishing the Game

Once all questions are answered the trivia library will call your `displayThankyou( )` function. Notice how the game results are also displayed in this function. Your thank you screen HTML provides a restart button that will allow the player to play again. **Update your `displayThankyou( )` function to match the one below.**

{% code title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
function displayThankyou() {
  $(".screen").hide();
  $("#thankyou-screen").show();
  $("#game-results").html(`You got ${trivia.totalCorrect} of ${trivia.totalAnswered} correct.`);
}
```
{% endcode %}

**Your core trivia game code should work from start to finish now.**
