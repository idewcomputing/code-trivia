# 4. Thank You Screen

### HTML for Thank You Screen Content

Below you see that we are updating the thank you screen much like your welcome screen, but you will definitely want to put some game results here later instead of saying, "Looks like you did pretty well." The _id_ called "game-results" will help us easily insert the game results later.

**Update your** _**thank you screen**_ **HTML to match the code below.**

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="HTML" %}
```markup
<!-------------- THANK YOU SCREEN --------------->
<div class='screen' id='thankyou-screen'>
  <h1>Thanks for playing our game!</h1>
  <h4 id='game-results'>Looks like you did pretty well.</h4>
  <button class="start-btn">Restart</button>
</div>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Again, no additional CSS to add.
