# 5. Core JS Functions

### HTML to Load JavaScript Libraries

**Add the code below to the bottom of your HTML.** These script tags load libraries that make coding your game much easier. **Say thank you to all the people that work on free and open source projects!!** We are adding the [tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop), [jquery](https://jquery.com/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), and the iDEW trivia libraries here. You don't have to worry too much about how these work just yet. They just do!

### Core JavaScript Functions of Trivia Game

We are assuming you don't want your trivia game to be a static page and make people scroll down the screen just to see a trivia question. That's where JavaScript comes in to give you control of how the trivia game interacts and displays content when and where you want.

* **setup\( \)** This function runs once when the visitor first comes to the page.  For example, we will load the question database here.
* **displayWelcome\( \) , displayQuestion\( \) ,  displayThankyou\( \)** These functions control what is displayed for each of our screens.
* **onClickedAnswer\( \) , onClickedStart\( \)** These functions control what happens when buttons are clicked.

Copy the JavaScript below and paste it in the JS section of your CodePen. Nothing new will happen just yet though. That's next.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
//Runs once at the beginning
function setup() {
  //more code will go here... 
}

function displayWelcome() {
  //more code will go here...
}

function displayQuestion() {
  //more code will go here...
}

function displayThankyou() {
  //more code will go here...
}

function onClickedAnswer(isCorrect) {
  //more code will go here...
}

function onClickedStart() {
  //more code will go here...
}

```
