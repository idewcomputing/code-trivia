# 4. Thank You Screen

### HTML for Thank You Sceen Content

Modify your _thank you screen_ HTML as below. This is very similar to your welcome screen, but you will definitely want to put some game results here later instead of saying, "Looks like you did pretty well." The _id_ called "game-results" will help us easily insert the game results later.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="HTML" %}
```markup
<!-------------- THANK YOU SCREEN --------------->
<div class='screen' id='thankyou-screen'>
  <h1>Thanks for playing our game!</h1>
  <h4 id='game-results'>Looks like you did pretty well.</h4>
  <button class="start-btn">Restart</button>
</div>
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

Again, no additional CSS to add.
