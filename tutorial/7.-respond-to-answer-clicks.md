# 7. Respond to Answer Clicks

### When a Player Clicks an Answer

The `onClickedAnswer( )` function is called whenever a player clicks an answer. You will notice that a parameter, `isCorrect`, is "passed" to the function to indicate whether the answer is correct or not. Based on the answer we will provide appropriate feedback by inserting text and showing the "feedback" HTML element. We will also highlight the correct answer by adding a "highlight" class to the correct answer button. Finally, we will wait 3 seconds then use the trivia library method to `gotoNextQuestion`. Modify your function to match the one below.

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="JavaScript" %}
```javascript
function onClickedAnswer(isCorrect) {
  if (isCorrect) $("#feedback").html(`Way to go!`).show();
  else $("#feedback").html(`Better luck next time.`).show();
  $("#correctAnswer").addClass("highlight"); //highlight right answer
  setTimeout(trivia.gotoNextQuestion, 3000); //wait 3 secs...next question
}

```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

If you run your trivia now you will notice a couple of problems once you get passed the first question.
